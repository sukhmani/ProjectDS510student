Student Grade Prediction Using Supervised Machine Learning
1. Data Acquisition
Load the Student Performance dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

2. Data Preprocessing
Fill in missing values.

Encode categorical variables (e.g., gender, parental education).

Scale features to normalize data range.

3. Define Tasks & Select Models
A. Classification Task
Goal: Predict whether a student will pass or fail.
Models Used:

Logistic Regression

Decision Tree Classifier

B. Regression Task
Goal: Predict exam score (numerical outcome).
Models Used:

Linear Regression

Random Forest Regressor

4. Model Evaluation
For Classification:
Accuracy

F1 Score

For Regression:
RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error)

5. Interpretation & Application
Analyze results to identify students who may need academic support.

Understand key influencing factors (e.g., study time, past grades).

Apply findings in educational planning and student intervention.
